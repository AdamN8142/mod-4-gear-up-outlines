  Name of your Gear Up Presentation: Why Should We Hire More Women in Tech?
  
  Talking points for your presentation:
  
  - Self introduction
  - Some may feel that it seems contrived or maybe unfair to seek out more women in the field, but there are legitimate reasons why we need to close the gender gap
  - Current conditions => 20% women in tech, 50% women in workforce, 700000 unfilled positions in U.S.
  - Women think and act differently
  - Diversity leads to innovation
  - Less discrimination if tech people are around more women
  - Women in leadership lead to high profitability
  - Women make up the bulk of the American Consumer
  - Lack of innovation in women-focused sub-industries
  - Hiring more women now will lead to more girls becoming interested in tech
  - We need more people in tech, period
  
  2-3 discussion questions you might want people to discuss after your presentation:
    1. 
    2. Have you experienced hesitations when working with people who have a different gender identity?
    3. What are ways that you can encourage other women in your lives or at your workplace to join tech or to pursue leadership?"
