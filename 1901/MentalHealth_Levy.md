  Mental Health in the Workplace

  Introduction
  Mental health statistics (1 in 5 adults are living with mental illness etc.)
  Brief descriptions of common diagnosis (depression, anxiety, ADHD)
  ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA) recently broadened the definition of disability to provide legal protections against employment discrimination for more individuals with disabilities, including people with psychiatric disabilities.
  How diagnosis could affect employment

  Why do employees not disclose their mental health concerns in the workplace?
  Fear
  Promotions in performance-oriented culture
  Judged for taking days off work for mental health
  Judged as not being as productive as mentally healthy employees
  “the people least likely to speak up are the people who are already marginalized and vulnerable to begin with: women and non-binary folks, people of color, recent hires who are still in the early stages of their career, adults over 50, and people with other disabilities.”

  "Matt, this is a great outline and it is very clear how your talk will be presented.  I want you to reconsider the questions for discussion. I don't think that many people will be willing to share that type of information in a group of new people they haven't known very long.  Maybe instead you focus on...

  Did you know about the mental health landscape for people today?
  Have you considered the impact of reporting mental health needs in the workplace?
  What can you do as a teammate and developer to help support people with specific mental health needs?"


  2-3 discussion questions you might want people to discuss after your presentation:
    1. Did you know about the mental health landscape for people today?
    2. Have you considered the impact of reporting mental health needs in the workplace?
    3. What can you do as a teammate and developer to help support people with specific mental health needs?"
