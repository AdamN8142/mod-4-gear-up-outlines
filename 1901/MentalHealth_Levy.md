  Introduction
  - Mental Health in the Workplace
  - Connection to gear up: Inclusiveness in tech of people living with mental illness
  - Important to me because:
    1. I have family members and friends that live with mental illnesses
    2. I have worked jobs where I did not feel the culture was supportive

  Intro to Mental Health
  - Mental health statistics (1 in 5 adults are living with mental illness etc.)
  - Brief descriptions of common diagnosis (depression, anxiety, ADHD)
  - ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA) recently broadened the definition of disability to provide legal protections against - employment discrimination for more individuals with disabilities, including people with psychiatric disabilities.
  - How diagnosis could affect employment

  Why do employees not disclose their mental health concerns in the workplace?
  - Fear
  - Promotions in performance-oriented culture
  - Judged for taking days off work for mental health
  - Judged as not being as productive as mentally healthy employees
  - “the people least likely to speak up are the people who are already marginalized and vulnerable to begin with: women and non-binary folks, people of color, recent hires who are still in the early stages of their career, adults over 50, and people with other disabilities.”

  2-3 discussion questions you might want people to discuss after your presentation:
    1. Did you know about the mental health landscape for people today?
    2. Have you considered the impact of reporting mental health needs in the workplace?
    3. What can you do as a teammate and developer to help support people with specific mental health needs?"
