Name of your Gear Up Presentation: Knowledge and Values

Talking points for your presentation:  

Below is the script for my content:  

I’m going to be talking about the American Academy in the 19th Century
The reason for this is that during this time there was a big shift in the values and foundation of colleges and university. I find it very difficult to maintain a clear sense of what one believes and knows, because, for the most part, what one knows and believes is simply what one knows and believes.

Thus this description of the academy in the 19th century is a way of investigating the fact that what we know can have significant impact on our implicit beliefs. Then using that as a jumping off point for trying to think about our individual knowledge and how that impacts our software development.

In early 19th century America, study in universities centered around the “classical curriculum” including work in Greek, Latin, and, of course, the Bible. Accordingly, a philosophy of the “the unity of truth” guided academic belief. A “unity of truth” meant that all knowledge, from physics to biblical exegesis, was believed to be reconcilable – All knowledge is part of a single whole.

In response to experiments at some colleges, such as offering students some choices in the courses they took, the faculty in New Haven published The Yale Report of 1828. The Report argued strongly and effectivly in favor of the classical curriculum – influencing colleges to stay the course – for a time.
 
OK, so that’s 1828 — Greek, Latin, the Bible; little student choice.
 
1859: Darwin publishes “On the Origin of Species”.
Darwin’s work challenged “classical curriculum” on three levels: (1): The scientific theory of evolution challenged biblical exegesis. (2): The scientific method in the work offered the promise of unprecedented technological progress and called into question other types of knowledge. And finally, (3): there was a philosophical challenge. Can or even should the Bible form the basis for all knowledge a direct challenge to the “Unity of Truth.”

1862: The Morrill Land-Grant act was passed.
The Land-Grand act gave explicit provision and support for technical and practical education. Institutions not called Harvard and Yale started to grow and see success. 

Harvard and Yale had maybe anticipated this shift, offering science degrees starting in the 1840s. However, the science degrees were designed, and thought of to be explicitly second rate options: Not admitted to pursue a BA? Maybe try for a BS.

By the end of the 19th century, these “alternate” courses of study had become popular. In an 1885 debate between the presidents of Harvard and Princeton, the arguments for an elective curriculum – where each student could choose their own course of study – won out over arguments for the classical curriculum.

The widespread adoption of the elective curriculum revitalized the academy bringing new monies, students and pressures not present in the days of Homer and Herodotus.
 
Ok great – science had gotten better, there was demand for practical (and more exciting) education – so what?

If we look at the state of the academy today, we might think it is mostly reasonable and coherent. We might look back to 1801 and, on one-hand, dismiss the state of the academy as anachronistic by today’s standards, but on the other hand, see that for the time, it was mostly reasonable and coherent.

Maybe both are reasonable and coherent, but the two are worlds away from each other. However, the changes arrived as mere additions and deletions from the course catalogue. Dropping Latin as a graduation requirement might seem unimportant, but it may actually indicate the presence of a tectonic shift in values and beliefs.

College was always about “Higher education”, but the conception of “Higher education” changed drastically from “Having a Christian knowledge / understanding of the world,” to  “Having Scientific knowledge / understanding of the world” (and oh, by the way, that might include knowing something about Christianity.)

That’s all the 19th Century. What about software development?

As a way of starting discussion, I want to offer a gross simplification and parallel to the 19th Century Academy:

In making decisions in your software development: Are you human / emotionally oriented and making rational decisions? Or are you rationally  / logically oriented and making human / emotional decisions? When has that been useful? When has that been detrimental?

As software developers we constantly make choices - large and small - from what processes and technologies to use, to what assumptions and simplifications to make, to what stylistic conventions to implement. In making these choices, we draw upon our knowledge and therefore our values.

My broad question is this: When making decisions in your software development, what types of knowledge and values do you draw upon most?


I know this is a complicated question so I’ll give an example.

With a moderate Math background I find reading logic with shorter variable names mostly straight forward. I believe that logic largely speaks for itself, and as such my code is probably not as friendly for people without a similar math / logic background.

I gain in brevity, but potentially lose in clarity for others who might read my code.

My main orientation is logical / rational, but have to do so within a human context.

Alternatively, maybe I know the importance of accessible web design, and work hard to ensure my app is customizable with very friendly UI.

I gain in user experience, but potentially lose in simplicity and speed.


I don’t want to suggest these decisions are either/or, this is to help move the discussions along.

Alternately:

To what extent can the decisions be parceled into one area or another?

Would your answer change when talking about decisions outside of software development?

Is that division unfair? If so, why?
