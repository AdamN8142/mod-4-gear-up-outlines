Name of your Gear Up Presentation: Bye, Bye Binary

Talking points for your presentation:
  * Use the Genderbread Person to discuss the differences between Sex/Gender, Identity/Expression and Romantic/Sexual Attraction
  * Talk about how the binary is either reinforced or deconstructed by forms, language and databses
  * Give examples of good and bad websites

2-3 discussion questions you might want people to discuss after your presentation: 
1. What challenges do you think a non-binary future will bring for tech?
2. What can we do as software developers to solve those challenges?
3. In what ways can you challenge your own binaries, whether sexual, gendered or other?
