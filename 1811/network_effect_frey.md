## Presentation Outline:

- Title Slide
    - Introduce Myself
    - Why I choose this topic.
      - I continually have been told it is not those who are the best at coding that get jobs the fastest, but those with the strongest network.

- Define "The Network Effect"
    - The network effect is a phenomenon whereby increased numbers of people or participants improve the value of a good or service. The Internet is an example. As more users gained access to the Internet, they produced more content, information, and services. More websites were developed, and more users connected to communicate with each other. These developments made the Internet increasingly valuable to its users.

  - (Find Graphics - a video or series of pictures? for this)
  - Adding a node
    - Creates an exponential effect
      - Adds the connection of that node as well
        - Show graph of number of connections
          - Add another node
            - Show graph of Number of Connections

- Parallel to Turing Community/Job Hunt
  - Slide: Meet "Jane", Jane is a software developer at Turing (how she gives to her community, number of connections, value of those connections)
  - Repeat this for 3 different characters and show their graphs of the strength of their network
  - One person with a lot of acquiantences,
  - One person with a handful of deep connections

- Who get their dream job faster?



## Discussion Questions:
1. What are you currently doing to build your network?
2. How are you contributing to your network?
3. What opportunities have you encountered as a result of your network?
