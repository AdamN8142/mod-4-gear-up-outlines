Name of your Gear Up Presentation: Dark Web

Introduction of yourself: David Cisneros

Why did you select this topic? Why is it of interest? I chose to do this topic to educate the dangers of privacy in sites and how it can lead to leaking someones personal information onto the dark webs.

Detailed description of the topic/history of the topic: The Dark Web is a term that refers specifically to a collection of websites that are publicly visible, but hide the IP addresses of the servers that run them.

How does this connect to mission of Gear Up? We have a responsibilty to protect our users infomation from being exposed to these sites that can affect their lives.

How will this impact you as a developer? This will impact me as developer to be more conscious of users privacy

Write 2-3 discussion questions you might want people to discuss after your presentation: 1. Do you think you have been compromised? 2. How does that make you feel that we have this kind of power at our fingertips? 3. How does this make you feel that your data maybe out there?

Anything additional you are adding to your talk? _________________________
