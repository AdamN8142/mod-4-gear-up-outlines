Name of your Gear Up Presentation: Performative Inclusion

Introduction of yourself: Hello, my name is Edgar Munoz. I am in mod4 of this program and I am going to talk to you all about something called performative inclusion.

Why did you select this topic? Why is it of interest? The reason I selected this topic is because I have had conversations with women and poc who work in the industry. We know that the industry is trying to change. Turing is ahead of the curve in that respect. And I want to talk about some of the pitfalls orgs can fall into when they think they are being inclusive/are trying to be inclusive.

Detailed description of the topic/history of the topic: First exclusion and examples, then attempts at inclusion and their shortcomings, where we are now, what you can do next.

How does this connect to mission of Gear Up? The goal of technology, the goal of Turing is to bring more perspectives to developing technology so that our civilization uses all of its smart people from all backgrounds to create progress. Maybe talk about how inclusion initiatives have helped me.

How will this impact you as a developer? Will help me to continue to bridge the gap between where we are and where we should be in a nuanced, professional way.

Write 2-3 discussion questions you might want people to discuss after your presentation: 
1. What does inclusion feel like to you? (Start by me talking about what exclusion feels like)
2. What could an organization do better to help you continue to feel that feeling of being included
3. Do you feel you are smarter + more creative in an inclusive space or in a not so inclusive space? Why?

Anything additional you are adding to your talk? _________________________
