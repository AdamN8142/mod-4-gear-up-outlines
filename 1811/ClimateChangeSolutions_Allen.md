Name of your Gear Up Presentation:

Tech Solutions To Reducing Carbon Emissions (for now)

Introduction of yourself:

I'm Tim Allen. I am a Mod 4 Back End Software Developer, and I am also a human on this planet. I need food, water and air to survive. I also need shelter and moderate temperatures. All of these things have depended on the Earth being a certain way for many years.

Why did you select this topic?  Why is it of interest?:

I selected this topic because of the extreme relevance to all life on Earth. Climate Change is destructive, human-caused, and highly related to the burning of fossil fuels. Tech people are some of the most creative problem-solvers out there and I wanted to learn about solutions that community has come up with for transitioning into renewable energies that do not contribute to carbon emissions. I also see it as sort of a call to action for developers out there to think about these issues because if we don't do something about this, we can't assume someone else will.

Detailed description of the topic/history of the topic:

Climate change is the term we use to describe the warming of Earth's oceans. Scientists have gathered substantial evidence that it is a direct result of carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. The byproducts of the warming of the oceans are extreme weather conditions like mega-hurricanes, polar vortexes, increases in wildfires and the extinctions of countless plant and animal life that our ecosystem relies on. The most dangerous effect that may occur is the rising of the oceans. Switching to renewable energies has been a commonly proposed solution in the past, but a more drastic and potentially necessary solution being engineered is geo-engineering. This takes carbon out of the atmosphere.

How does this connect to mission of Gear Up?

Gear Up is directly related to the awareness of social problems that exist in our society, and for encouraging activities to become part of the solution. While it may not directly correlate to Turing's mission statement, or be as specific to the tech community and human inter-group relations as Gear Up usually is, I do feel there is an extreme relevance. I feel that the understanding that we cannot operate in the world without empathy for those around us, understanding the effects of our actions and doing what we can for the community at large (plants and animals included) is the fundamental value of Gear Up. In the words of the late, great Stan Lee: "With great power comes great responsibility." At the end of the day, nothing else we do matters if we end up destroying out planet.

How will this impact you as a developer?:

I have always wanted to have a job that helps solve this issue somehow, but if I am not able to get a job like that, I will try to be aware of how the software I work on affects climate change (positively, negatively, or neutrally). I will additionally continue to be a voice at my company, at conferences and in my community vocalizing the importance and priority of this dangerous issue. If in 8 years, the world is where it is now, I may even try to start my own company to try to use tech to transition into a renewable energy economy.

Write 2-3 discussion questions you might want people to discuss after your presentation:
  1. What is something you can do at your future companies to help the situation?
  2. What are possible technical solutions that we have not talked about to help transition to renewable energy
  3. What are things you can do in the public opinion sector to try to encourage the community to take this issue seriously?

 Anything additional you are adding to your talk? _________________________
