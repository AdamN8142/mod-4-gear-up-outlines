Name of your Gear Up Presentation: IOT the next indrustrial revolution  

### Introduction of yourself:

My name is Manoj Panta. Currently doing BE mod 4.

### Why did you select this topic? Why is it of interest?

I chose this topic because i was really interested in hardaware and software integration
for a long time. As a kid i enjoyed playing with hardwares of many electronic devices. I did not know about
the term IOT until i was introduced to it by one of my friends couple months back. I will be doing some IOT project after i graduate from Turing. Buying microcontrollers and other hardware parts needed for simple IOT devices are getting cheaper and cheaper nowadays. Thanks to companies like arduino.

Detailed description of the topic/history of the topic:

If we go into the definition of the Internet of Things, we find out that it is the concept of inter-networking of physical devices, connected devices, smart devices, and other devices embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and network connectivity that enable these objects to collect and exchange data.

What it means, is that an object  controlled remotely across the existing network infrastructure that enables direct integration of the physical world into computer-based systems, which, in turn, improves their efficiency and accuracy and reduces human intervention

IOT devices have this concept of Embedded programming. These  devices have microcontroller like: Arduino, with custom printed circuit boards(PCBs).

Prototyping with these platforms requires circuit design skills, micro-controller programming, and a deep understanding of hardware communication protocols like serial, I2C, or SPI used to establish communication between the micro-controller and the connected sensors and actuators

### How does this connect to mission of Gear Up?

Security is one of the most critical concerns in IoT, closely related to data ethics, privacy and liability. It must be built-in at every step of the design of the system. With millions of new devices connected every day, the number of potential points of attack grows daily. With so much at stake, security engineering skills, including threat assessment, ethical hacking, encryption to ensure data integrity, securing network architectures and applications, as well as event monitoring, activity logging, and threat intelligence, move to the foreground of the IoT development projects.


I brought up this  as a Gear Up topic because our data as a customer is getting more
vulnerable but as a software engineer we can minimize the possibility.

## How will this impact you as a developer?
Write 2-3 discussion questions you might want people to discuss after your presentation: 1. 2. 3.

1. How could you design these devices in a way that cosumers's data will me more secured.
Here are some things that you could discuss:
- datas collected from consumer's device will be stored only on be  consumer's device
and we make our algorithm better in local level and update the main algorithm based on
the changes on local level algorithm.
- the problem with that though, the price of these devices will go up due to needs of
more powerful micro controller, storage etc.

2. Also what IOT devices do you think would be helpful in our daily life that is not
invented yet(you do not have to research if that has been invented already)
