  #### Name of your Gear Up Presentation: 
  
  Squashing Hate-Speech: Why it matters - Where we are going
  
  #### Introduction of yourself: 

  My name is Mason, FE mod4, he/him, and I grew up in a hot-bed of hate known as Colorado Springs.
  
  #### Why did you select this topic?  Why is it of interest? 

  Once upon a time, I got a degree in political science and had particular interest in constitutional law. Fundamental to our constitution is a freedom of speech, however hate-speech and fighting words are not protected. I have always been interested in these grey areas- what qualifies as hate speech, how is it recognized, are there approaches to filtering speech that have been ruled on by judges? Also, I have always been interested in the sociological aspects of legalities- what groups are most impacted, who is spreading poisonous thoughts and why?
  
  #### Detailed description of the topic/history of the topic: 

  Well, could probably link to a human history textbook here... but as far as the internet is concerned, and I still need to research this a lot more, but I think very early on in the internet days people with hateful views found each other to discuss topics very early. With the internet, people with views that don't allow them to function very well in society now didn't really need to function in society at all- they could just internet all day and stew in their beliefs and be anonymous while they did so.

  We see examples of the impact of this all the time, whether its innocent users being exposed to hateful ideas, bullying leading to tragedy, or enough power in numbers to make overt actions of hate at rallies.

  #### How does this connect to mission of Gear Up?

  I think we as developers have a responsibility to address some of the flaws of the internet in order to better serve everyone. As we make apps, we may want to think about fringe groups that may abuse tech anonymously. 
  
  #### How will this impact you as a developer? 

  I think conceptualizing an internet experience that is more inclusive of everyone is a fundamental, societal challenge that developers will need to make headway on in the near future. How do we bring people together rather than isolate in anonymous corners of the internet? What can we do as developers to help users 'buy in' to take ownership of the experience created there? Are there ways AI can utilize deep learning to nip problem areas in the bud? How do we approach potential projects that seem like they may open the doors to hate? Are there places to look for examples of success?
  
  #### Write 2-3 discussion questions you might want people to discuss after your presentation:
    1. What is your reaction when you see this type of speech online? (I bet many, like myself, are so used to it, it doesn't phase them, so what does that say about the state of things?)
    2. What ideas do you have to limit hateful online content?
    3. Do you see the internet user experience evolving in the next 10 years? What might that look like?
    
#### Anything additional you are adding to your talk? 

I am most def refining ideas still, but hope to include concrete examples of the ramifications of hate-speech, as well as some research about what pshychological impact it may have, if anything like that is out there.
