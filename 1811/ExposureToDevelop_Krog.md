- Introduction of yourself: My name is Michael Krog, I am currently a Front End Developer in Mod 4 at Turing. Previously I worked in Digital Marketing for 6 years and have been exposed to all different types of technology. I have had an amazing opportunity in life to see and experience the power of technology and how awesome it is to become a developer.

- Why did you select this topic?  Why is it of interest? The reason I chose this topic was to bring light to how fortunate everyone here is today, experiencing/learning technology together and what that means for us moving forward. It is extremely important to realize how lucky we all are to be here, and also think and expand upon ways others who are less fortunate than ourselves can share the profound experience of learning to be a developer.

- Detailed description of the topic/history of the topic: This topic is meant to go over how underrepresented people are in the exposure of technology and learning to create. This will go over a detailed reasons why and as well as where these groups of people are.

- How does this connect to mission of Gear Up? This connects with Turing’s mission because, I feel it’s important to unlock any humans potential, no matter who or where they are in the world, in succeeding a technical career.

- How will this impact you as a developer? This will impact me as a developer because I love learning the skills of being a developer. I want to share these skills and show others that anyone can do amazing things no matter who they are.

- Write 2-3 discussion questions you might want people to discuss after your presentation:
  1. From the current solutions in place, do you think this is enough
  2. How can someone who succeed in technology if they don’t have access to traditional computer science degrees or technical bootcamps.
  3. What can you do as a developer to help bring underprivileged individuals into technical careers.

- Anything additional you are adding to your talk?
