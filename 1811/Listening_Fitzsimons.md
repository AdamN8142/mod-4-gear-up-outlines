# Listening: 

### Introduction: 
#### Eric Fitzsimons, ex-educator, world-traveler, excellent listener/hugger, and champion of all things inclusive.

### Why this topic: 
#### I lam very proud to say that I was raised by women.  Nearly all of the people that were influential in shaping my worldview as I grew up were progress, liberal-minded women.  From my mother to babsitters, my youth group leader to the church pastor, many of my teachers.  When my father remarried, it was to a women's/civil-rights advocate, and it's not like he was a carbon copy of the Marlboro man.  

#### When I went to college, I was surprised by how much competition there was, even amongst my friends/roommates.  There wasn't as much celebration for each other's successes, but often jealousy.  This is the exact opposite of the growth mindset that we are hoping that more people will employ in the future.  There was too much emphasis placed on what was being said rather than what was being heard.  This created too many individuals, too much conflict.

#### This is not to say that all men are bad at listening, and that all women are good at it.  The important aspect here is to understand that we all have biases that can act as barriers for effective communication.

#### Example Barriers: 

#### Receiving Stage/Interpreting Stage

#### These are areas where either the environment, cognitive issues, or comprehension can hurt one's ability to listen.

#### Evaluating State
#### This is where we as a listener, either consciously or unconsciously become less effective at receiving information.
- Excessive Talking
  - Indicates a lack of respect
- Prejudice
  - Can happen for a number of reasons and can happen to people of any gender/race
- Expecting Others to share your Personal Beliefs
  - Effective listening can still happen when you disagree with someone.  In fact, this is probably a time when listening becomes more important as it will help facilitate a better outcome (all parties feel respected, ideas feel appreciated rather than in-the-way)
- Misunderstaning
  - Could happen because the speaker is not explaining well.
  - Could happen because the listener is not actively trying to understand/comprehend.
- Interrupting
  - Indicates that your voice is more important than the person speaking.
- Faking attention
  - Especially in a situation where the same idea that was raised by one person, and when it is brought up again by another, that person gets credit.  The audience was clearly not actually willing to listen to this person.  
- Bringing in Emotions
- Fear

### Detailed description of the topic/history of the topic: Being willing to actually listen to someone requires respect.  Paying attention to other people is not the same as being present when they talk.

### Interesting annecdote: 
#### Anne Mulcahy, the former chairman and CEO of Xerox. Three years ago Mulcahy decided it was time to treat herself and went shopping for a Porsche. After test-driving one beauty — a 911 Cabriolet — she announced to the salesman that she'd take the car. After a pregnant pause, he responded, "Don't you have to talk to someone about that first?" Her reply: "If you don't start working on the paperwork in the next 10 seconds, I'll drive 30 minutes to the next Porsche dealer and buy the car there."

#### What about this interaction was difficult?  Person goes into store, tests item, offers to buy item, assumption is made by second person, chaos insues.

### How does this connect to mission of Gear Up? 
#### It emphasizes the importance of inclusivity rather than exclusivity.  It endeavors to connect people to one another rather than keeping us separated.

### How will this impact you as a developer? 
#### The more that devs are capable of hearing one another when preparing for a large project, the better the outcome.  If people don't feel that they are being heard, they will be less likely to share their ideas.  In an affirming community, even bad ideas are good, as they can flush out avenues that shouldn't be taken.

### Discussion Questions

#### 1. Think of one bias you have that might impact your ability to hear what a coworker might suggest as a solution to a problem.
#### 2. How willing are you to accept the flaws in your ideas/arguments when they are pointed out by others?
#### 3. How do you deal with topics/situations that you would prefer to avoid when they come up in a conversation that cannot be ignored?  What emotions come to mind?  Actions?
