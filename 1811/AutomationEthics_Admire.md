#### Name of your Gear Up Presentation:

'The Ethics of Automation'

#### Introduction of yourself:

Jake Admire

#### Why did you select this topic? Why is it of interest? 

I selected 'The Ethics of Automation' because automation is something that I find very fascinating and difficult. 
There are so many pros and cons to it that weight well against eachother that it's honestly difficult for me to pick a side.

#### Detailed description of the topic/history of the topic: 

Automation is something that humans have tried to do for their tasks for a very long time. 
There are records from ancient Egypt of designs of 'water clocks' that would make keeping track of the time easier for somebody. 
I think it's really fascinating to think about 'keeping track of time' as a full-time job in the first place.
We're priveledged with our clocks. Maybe some day our children will be priveledged with their self-driving vehicles.

#### How does this connect to mission of Gear Up? 

I believe discussing the ethical results of any 'thing' relate perfectly to the mission of Gear Ups.
Engaging and informing people about a prominant topic in our industry that can, has and will affect millions of people.

#### How will this impact you as a developer? 

As a developer I'm definitely happy to have the information that I've learned in writing this talk.
I think that this information is very important to have some kind of understand of.

#### Synthesis/Talk Closing statement: 

I want people to consider the pros/cons of implementing automated machines to replace jobs.
Maybe the job was dangerous and it's much better to provide a way of completing the tasks without putting humans in harms way.
Maybe somebody lost their livelihood to a robot. There's a lot to consider in both arguments.

#### Write 2-3 discussion questions you might want people to discuss after your presentation: 

1. Do you think it's better to embrace progress and move forward strongly with these autonomous implementations or should we do our best to prevent it?

2. Are you afraid/uncomfortable with self-driving vehicles? Why / why not?

#### Anything additional you are adding to your talk?
