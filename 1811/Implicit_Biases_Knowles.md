#### Name of your Gear Up Presentation:  Implicit biases in Tech ####
  
##### Introduction of yourself: ##### 
  
  
##### Why did you select this topic?  Why is it of interest? #####
During a lot of Gear Ups discussions in my time at Turing, I've grown increasingly frustrated with the lack of acknowledgement of biases. Often times, I've heard people say how they don't believe things like race or gender identity change the way they treat people. 

I want to educate people on the concept of implicit bias. 

As programmers, we'll be building products for all kinds of people, so we want to make sure we are not being exclusive. 

##### Detailed description of the topic/history of the topic: #####  

Implicit bias is defined as, ‘the attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions in an unconscious manner.’ Even the most open, socially consicous person, will tend to associate positive attributes with the people that look like them or the people that are portrayed positively in the media. 

It is important to note that implicit biases are pervasive and they _do not_ necessarily align with our belief system. 

Nevertheless, our unconscious attitudes towards certain groups of people impact our actions. For example, a 2012 study that examined how pediatricians’ implicit racial attitudes affect treatment recommendations found that as pediatricians' pro-white bias increased they were more likely to prescribe painkillers for atients who were White as opposed to Black.

As programmers, we should be conscious of our biases so that they don't translate into our code or into our hiring practices (disguised as "culture fit" hiring). 

##### How does this connect to mission of Gear Up? #####  
I want people to think critically about their own biases with less judgement.


##### How will this impact you as a developer? #####  
As a developer, I want to be aware of my biases so that I can address them consistently. 

##### Write 2-3 discussion questions you might want people to discuss after your presentation:##### 
1. Do you think implicit biases affect the hiring process?
2. How can you address your biases?
3. How can companies work to address implicit biases as an organization?
