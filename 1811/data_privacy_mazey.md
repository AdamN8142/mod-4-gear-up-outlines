Name of your Gear Up Presentation: Data in Tech

Introduction of yourself: Ty Mazey Backend Mod 4

Why did you select this topic?  Why is it of interest? Data, data privacy, and ethical data scraping in tech has been making waves in the news and in talks all over as a new concept in the past few years. Considering we are getting in to software development in at the current height of these discussions it will shape the companies we work for and the decisions being made all around us, differently then what we might have previously seen.

Detailed description of the topic/history of the topic: Data privacy specifically regarding the collection and sale of data. How user data is a new resource, and although not tangible is being farmed by companies all over the world for the progression of new technologies or simply for profit. To take a look and consider what data is being farmed that will have positive impacts, e.i. language recognition, psychology, public safety. Also looking at the things that could have negative impacts, e.i. selling data as a marketing resource, or creating biases or obfuscation of information based on things.

How does this connect to mission of Gear Up? Data privacy directly connects to the ethics of using information based on human interaction and technology.

How will this impact you as a developer? Again, as new developers entering into the tech field, the rise of this new concept, data as a resource, will impact our futures, the companies we work for futures and we need to have an opinion on the way we want to participate in shaping things.

Write 2-3 discussion questions you might want people to discuss after your presentation:
  1. Regarding collection of data, are the current outcomes particularly positive or negative in its current state?
  2. Should we consider data a resource, and like anything else tax it as such, or do we continue to let companies control the decision making process in what data to collect and what to do with that data?
  3. MAYBE - Do you think as the tech industry continues to grow and the discussion of data collection grows that you will have an opinion on it, or will be impacted by it?

 Anything additional you are adding to your talk? _________________________
