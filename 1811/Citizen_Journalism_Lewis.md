  Name of your Gear Up Presentation: Citizen Journalism in the Internet Age

  Self Introduction

  Describe why I chose this topic

  Definition of citizen journalism: Public citizens (not trained journalists) collecting, reporting, analyzing, and disseminating news and information

  History of Citizen Journalism
    Citizen journalism has existed for hundreds of years
    Modern citizen journalism movement started in Korea in the early 2000s
    Result of easy access to Internet and the current political regime cracking down on media freedom
    Growth of OhmyNews - Korean news site with volunteer authors grew from 700 to 50,000 contributors from 2000 to 2007
    Since the 2000s, technology has made it easier and easier for common people to get involved in writing and spreading news

  Good Examples of Citizen Journalism
    2004 Indian Ocean tsunami - most of the important videos and images of the incident were taken by tourists, not journalists
    CNN iReport - Citizen journalism initiative launched by CNN
    Hyperlocal journalism - journalism focused toward the members of extremely specific or small communities

  Bad Examples of Citizen Journalism
    Reddit publicly misidentified the perpetrator of the 2013 Boston Bombing
    The prevalence of 'Fake News', sources have become more and more unreliable

  Write 2-3 discussion questions you might want people to discuss after your presentation:
    1. Do you think the benefits of giving more people access to writing and spreading news outweigh the potential risks? (misinformation, doxxing, etc.)
    2. Where do you primarily get your news from? How often do you check the sources of news that you read?
    3. Do you trust the news more or less than you have in the past?
