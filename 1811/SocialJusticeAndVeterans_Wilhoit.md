  Name of your Gear Up Presentation: Social Justice with Veterans and You
  
  Introduction of yourself: Tom Wilhoit, he/him, FrontEnd Mod 4
  
  Why did you select this topic?  Why is it of interest? As a veteran I believe there is plenty of open space for dialogue that is being underused.
  Detailed description of the topic/history of the topic: Strategies for creating empathy and closing the gap of social justice understanding between veterans and non-vetarns.
  
  How does this connect to mission of Gear Up? Social justice for/by veterans is not widly discussed in an open forum.
  
  How will this impact you as a developer? I think this will help me develop communication strategies for interactions in the future of my career.
  
  Write 2-3 discussion questions you might want people to discuss after your presentation:
    1. How to interact with a dismissive/hostile veteran
    2. How to open dialogue with veterans about sensitive social justice subjects. 
    3. How to create a safe space of shared learning and experience with veterans.

Veterans are not a monolith

Common veteran tropes in communities

		-Discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community as a byproduct of hyper-masculinity 
Reasons for these tropes/recruitment videos

	-Current service realities - It’s a hard job with little thanks
	-Post service realizations  *my personal truths* - Pros/cons
		-Few people care
		-You realize your position was replaceable 
			-imagine being pivotal on a deployment/rotation
			-suddenly realizing you were not necessary
	-The struggle for culture and identity

Common coping mechanisms for veterans
	-Self esteem
	-the loss of self identity 
	-the inability to relate to civilian world
		-I’m not talking about combat, just the day to day lifestyle 
Bring Hat-Human back
	-What do you think of the talk so far?
	-demonstrate the lack of awareness on both of our parts.
Strategies for dealing with hostile veterans
	-Gentle reeducation
		-Who here had a limited amount of social justice knowledge pre-turing?
		-Create parallels and dialogue
		-Give them time. Outrage = closed dialogue 
		-Understand that it is give and take. 
		-Many veterans have hard-earned lessons you could gain from
