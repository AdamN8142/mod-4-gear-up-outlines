  Name of your Gear Up Presentation: 
  - Enviromental empathy & education via incentivised tech use
  
  Introduction of yourself: 
  - My name is Devin and I like the environmnet more than you. I grew up in MN but really came to be the person I am now in Southern CA. My dive into the tech industry was inspired by my want to explore remote places and taking my career with me.  
  
  - Why did you select this topic?  Why is it of interest? I chose this topic because the more I explored the planet the more I saw how destructive and intrusive we are as a species.

  - metrics on negative impact

  - I wanted to mitigate my impact on the enviornment and so I made some serious lifestyle changes for myself. However, I believe as developers we have the ability to make a greater positive impact than any individual changing their personal lifestyle.
  
  Detailed description of the topic/history of the topic: 
  - A few people out there have similiar ideas and have approached this problem using tech.
  - examples of techs positive impact

  How will this impact you as a developer? 
  - At this point, I personally won't invest in a company that doesn't consider the environment a priority.
