  Name of your Gear Up Presentation: Ethical Considerations of Autonomous Vehicles

  Introduction of yourself: Peter Lapicola, BE Mod 4

  Why did you select this topic?  Why is it of interest?

  A few years ago when I was working in the IT field, I remember a coworker having a conversation with me about self driving cars where up until that point I had only seen them as a move towards a future where everyday people would get the benefit of a technologically orchestrated commute that was relatively hands off and offered the privacy of a personal vehicle while increasing the opportunities to explore personally interesting things while commuting instead of the high-attention requirement of commuting using a non-autonomous personal vehicle.

  In this conversation, my friend countered my overwhelming enthusiasm for the topic by posing me a thought question: 'What should the car do when a group of pedestrians enters the road unexpectedly?', to which I replied that the vehicle should be able to make the adjustment to avoid the incident far quicker than any human, and it should just swerve or brake to avoid the impact. From there, my friend prompted me further, 'But what happens if the only way to avoid the pedestrian is to run in to the wall?'. I hadn't considered that before, and from there on began approaching the topic of autonomous vehicles with more hesitation. I think there is a lot of good discussion, both around this potential circumstance and other such circumstances like how do these cars interact with non-autonomous vehicles, the data collection ethics, and the ethics of even having someone who has to program that decision in the first place.

  Detailed description of the topic/history of the topic:

  While many attempts have been made over the years to develop cars that remove or reduce the need for a human driver to function, it wasn't until within the last decade that the possibility that you may be capable of passing by another vehicle being driven entirely by computer on the road. Companies like Waymo (Formerly Google), Uber, Apple, GM, and Ford are all deep in development of driverless vehicles, but there's some big problems to tacle. I Plan to focus on the idea of making decicisions in software that could actively result in the detriment of well-being to a person, considerations regarding public roads and the possibility that in the future access could be restricted to autonomous vehicles, and the impact of having a private company able to monitor your activities and collect data on them for hours a day.

  How does this connect to mission of Gear Up? In Gear Up, we spend a lot of time discussing empathy for others; and all of the above points have ethical considerations: Is it ethical to have a person implement solutions that may need to intentionally cause harm, is it ethical to restrict public access to the roads if it is for the potential benefit and safety of others to those fortunate enough to have a specific vehicle, and how can we regulate the data collection from these vehicles?

  How will this impact you as a developer? Further enhancing my consideration of how I impact people's lives.

  Write 2-3 discussion questions you might want people to discuss after your presentation:
    1. How would you solve the problem of deciding vehicle actions?
    2. If you decide to have this from people, it is ethical to make someone implement that action?
    3. Is it ethical to restrict access to public services for the benefit of others.

   Anything additional you are adding to your talk? Not at this time.\

   ## Week 3 Work Time

   Feedback: The talk did a good job of covering the problems, however the solutions to the problem were not clear. Would feel better if the program ended on a positive note instead of an open ended note (Stronger conclusion).
