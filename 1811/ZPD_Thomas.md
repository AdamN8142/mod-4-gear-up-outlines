Name of your Gear Up Presentation:
  - The Zone of Proximal Development

Introduction of yourself:
  - Hello, my name is Scott Thomas and I'm a BE Mod 4 student. A brief bit about why I left my last career as an analytical lab tech. Explain how it was because I wasn't feeling rewarded or challenged. Lead into ZPD...

Why did you select this topic?  Why is it of interest?
  - I was sitting over break trying to decide what I wanted to do my talk on and asked Earl (Mod 3 BE) if he had any good ideas. He said that he was interested in doing more research on ZPD. After doing some initial research on it, I felt it perfectly embodied why I came to Turing. I could have chosen to do this on my own, but there is a certain aspect of learning new things that requires instruction. I also believe it directly ties in with one of Turing's basic beliefs - Growth Mindset. I also believe that the ZPD is where we achieve the most 'true learning'.

Detailed description of the topic/history of the topic:  
  - The Zone of Proximal Development, or ZPD, is the difference between what a learner can do without help and what they cannot learn without instruction.
  - It was a introduced by Psychologist Lev Vygotsky back in the 1920s. However, due to his untimely death, it was never finished.

How does this connect to mission of Gear Up?
  - True learning ends up happening somewhere between a topic being too easy and too challenging to understand. The area where you struggle to understand something (and it may require assistance) is where we truly learn the most. This means that we are going to be fighting the boundaries of failure or not understanding concepts all of the time here at Turing and in real-world situations. It is important to keep a Growth mindset when learning in general.

How will this impact you as a developer?
   - As mentioned above, we are all going to be learning ALOT on the fly as we start out as junior devs. We are going to fail a lot at first with of new languages, new frameworks, new concepts on the job. Keeping that growth mindset and remembering that pushing ourselves to the brink of failure is how we learn the most will come in handy every day on the job.

Write 2-3 discussion questions you might want people to discuss after your presentation:
  1. Think about how each of you learn the best. Do the concepts that you struggled with to learn stay committed to memory more than those you picked up easily?

  2. When something isn't going well, we tend to get frustrated and want to give up. However, how great does it feel when we finally figure it out. How often do you make the same mistake you took an hour debugging again? (Assuming they say rarely, talk about why they don't make the same mistake again).

  3. Another question tying in growth mindset.

 Anything additional you are adding to your talk?
  - I want to finish slides linking ZPD to the Growth Mindset and how moving forward in our careers this will play a huge role in our development.

Feedback:
Partner: Tim Allen
Summary: Thought the explanation of ZPD was good. He liked my segway from my past career and why I transitioned linking it to ZPD. Thought maybe a little more explanation of ZPD might help. Liked how I mentioned previous experiences at Turing from each learning zone and how I felt during each and where I thought optimal learning happens. Overall thought it was good and clean and with the last two slides would be good.
