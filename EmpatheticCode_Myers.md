## OUTLINE

### Each presentation should include 5-8 minutes of polished content with slides.

  `Name of your Gear Up Presentation`
  
  Empathetic Code
  
  `Introduction of yourself`
  
  My name is Kim Myers. I am in the Front-End Engineering program.
  
  `Why did you select this topic?  Why is it of interest?` 
  
  This is a topic I care a lot about. I have found that working in teams there has been a lot of time dedicated to reviewing code.
  If we write code with the with the idea that other people will be reading, reviewing and continuing to work on it we might make some different choices.
  On the other hand, when reviewing the code of others, there are important things to keep in mind as well.
  
  `Detailed description of the topic/history of the topic`
  
  We have talked a lot at Turing about the importance of empathy, specifically as it relates to our end user but we haven't talked a whole lot about our interactions with other developers.
  As developers a lot of the time we will be interacting with one another through code. Code reviews are commonplace in the industry so there are some important things to consider when writing and reviewing code.
  
  `How does this connect to mission of Gear Up?`
  
  Empathetic code creates a more inclusive environment on a development team. 
  It also helps a team succeed because less time is spent trying to figure out what someone else's code means.
  When your code is well executed you are more likely to have a well executed product which leads to high fulfillment.
  
  `How will this impact you as a developer?` 
  
  We will constantly either be writing, reviewing or contributing to code so THIS MATTERS!
  
  `Write 2-3 discussion questions you might want people to discuss after your presentation`
  
    1. What experiences have you had with empathetic or non-empathic code
    2. Consider this pull request (show pull request on slide). How could we modify this pull request to be more empathetic for our reviewer?
    3. What steps you will take moving forward to make your code more empathetic?
    
   `Anything additional you are adding to your talk?`
   
   Possible refactoring of code, but time may not allow and I will need to provide examples in both JS and Ruby which will be a little more involved.
