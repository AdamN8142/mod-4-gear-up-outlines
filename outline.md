    (these definately still need work)
    1. What are your feelings on job hunting? Interviewing? How can you help yourself feel good in those places?

Week 3 feedback:
  Include more of a personal intro, name, why I chose this topic
  Connect more directly to conversations, examples of conversations
  
  P.S. This morning Mod4 had an intro to Jun as the new counselor and his approach to counseling prompted me to ask his advice on how to deal with difficult situations in conversing and recognizing our body's reactions and how that can have a large impact on the mental reaction to a conversation. I've planned to meet with him next week to get his insight on the subject.
